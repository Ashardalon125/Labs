## Lab 1

For most of you this will comprise of the turtle lab on Runestone.

If you have extra time, here are your options:

1.  If your partner is here, work on finishing Weekly Seesion 1
2.  Markdown tutorial - how to format those "comment" cells in the Jupyter notebook, along with the ".md" files on GitHub

2.  HW3 - is posted, it is short
3.  Practice GitHb, I think I found the problem, it was in the permissions.
    * GitHub Tutorial on terminal methods: https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1
      *you would run these commands with the GitShell on a Window machine*
4.  Roster challenge.
    * Make a list of the students in class, first and last names.  Use the random.shuffle() to make a new set of teams for Monday (and next week).  Use some of the techniques from class this week, including for/while loops, if statements, strings, print statements, and embed it all in a function.  Number the teams.
    * Make this roster code your own Jupyter Notebook
    * Make your own repository on GitHub to store this notebook.  Push the notebook to GitHub, and open a pull request.
