    "You will model an interesting physics problem in depth - using either \n",
    "1. Romberg's integration method, or \n",
    "2. Euler's differential solver\n",
    "\n",
    "You should pick a well-defined problem described with 1-2 equations and solve it with your method of choice for a range of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be given 5+ hours of in class time to work and move your project forward.  Use it well.    \n",
    "\n",
    "** Note that you are producing a document you may share on your resume for potential future employers or graduate school advisors to view.  The final submitted version should be exceptional work of which you are proud.**\n",

    "    * Identify and describe the general physics (or chemistry) you are going to simulate \n",
    "\n",
    "2. MATHEMATICAL MODEL: 5\n",
    "   * Write down and describe relevant controlling equation (just one)\n",
    "   * Clarify specific scenario to be simulated\n",
    "   * Write down boundary conditions for that scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "3. CODE: 10 \n",
    "    * Your code should be clearly written using the good programming practices outlined in Chapter 2 of Newman.  You should strive to use generalized functions to solve the Euler method or the integrals, rather than writing this code from scratch.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. RESULTS: 20 \n",
    "    * Outline specific results to you obtained\n",
    "    * Describe how you verified that your results are correct or reasonable\n",
    "    * You should thoughtfully play with your parameters - and present a range of results.  This is the art and science of numerical modeling.  Picking good parameters and limiting cases is important.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4.  ANALYSIS:10 \n",
    "    * Describe your results, and how you verified them.  What parameters did you vary, and how did it affect the outcome of your model?\n",
    "    \n",
    "5.  SCIENTIFIC SUMMARY: 5\n",
    "    * In a few precise words, what did you scientific problem did you solve, what scientific goals did you complete, what do they mean, and why is it important?\n",

    "    * Meet all deadlines via commit on GitHub\n",
    "    * All documents and the repository should have meaningful names\n",
    "    * Create your own repository on GitHub - on your personal account, NOT your Physics-PacU folder. The repository should contain \n",
    "        * Your Project 1 jupyter notebook\n",
    "        * text (pdf) copies of any references you refer to\n",
    "        * Your presentation slides\n",
    "        * Any additional documents you prepare while making this project\n",
    "        \n",
    "    * Use sufficient commit messages and pull requests so that I can understand your changes\n",
    "    * Before class on Friday, check with me that your slides work properly on my Mac, or practice hooking your own laptop up to the AppleTV in class.\n",

    "    \n",
    "### Reporting your work\n",
    "These project requirements - code, writing, and images, should be contained within a Jupyter notebook, however, you are allowed to import matplotlib modules you have written yourself (such as your Euler code) or integrate.py or romberg.py.  No handwritten work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The document should be neat, well-labeled, well-documented (don't skip the docstrings), thoughtfully written (including spelling and grammar), and thoughtful.  Code, figures, and explanations should alternate throughout the document in a well presented way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The onus is on you to pick a project that you are interested in, and spend some time digging into the science in depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### References:\n",
    "You should cite 1-3 references - not more - from reputable scientific work.  Newman and wikipedia are not sufficient.  The citation style should follow your favorite scientific journal (i.e. the style used by Google Scholar or Physical Review Letters is suitable for physicists).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you check out [my google scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_uxV0IsAAAAJ&hl=en), you will see that my most cited work is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic regimes for driven colloidal particles on a periodic substrate at commensurate and incommensurate fillings,**  D. McDermott, J. Amelang, C.J.O. Reichhardt, C. Reichhardt,  Physical Review E 88 (6), 062301\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Presenting your work\n",
    "On Friday, March 8th\\* you will have 8 minutes to present your scientific topic, coding method, results, and analysis.  Be strategic with your time, you have roughly 2 minutes for each section of your talk.  You will also have 2 minutes for questions.  You are not allowed to go over in time.  You should practice so that you clearly present your work in the allotted time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggestion: [convert your Jupyter Notebook to slides](https://medium.com/@mjspeck/presenting-code-using-jupyter-notebook-slides-a8a3c3b59d67) rather than write a powerpoint"
